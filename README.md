# monodetection
This repository is initially created as a project idea for Intermediate Data Science (COSC 316) course at Augustana University (Augie)

## Future Plan (WIP)
**Imaged-based Obstacle Detection** is one of the most challenging tasks in Computer Vision. There have been a lot of efforts focused on using point cloud data for obstacle detection, especially in the field of vehicle autonomy. However, for the generation of point cloud data from images, you would typically need a serial camera, which is not very commonly accessible. This project aims to find and analyze any existing methods of converting monocular images into point cloud data and utilizing that data for obstacle detection. 

While projects which use phone cameras for object detection already exist, we believe that a model that uses point cloud data for object detection would give better results in realtime due to factors such as resilience to lighting conditions, object localization, and spatial understanding. However, we cannot be sure about the results until the successful completion of the project.
